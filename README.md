## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

##  Objectives for this project

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

- [x] I click the start button --> a timer starts and I am presented with a question

- [x] I answer a question --> I am presented with another question

- [x] I answer a question incorrectly --> time is subtracted from the clock

- [x] all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 --> the game is over

- [x] the game is over --> I can save my initials and my score

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
